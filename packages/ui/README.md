# Elevator System UI

## Run project

For instructions, please refer to the [main README](../../README.md).

## Config

You have the option to control certain aspects of the system's default behavior by modifying the variables in the `.env` file.

1. **REACT_APP_FLOOR**: This variable determines the default floor where the elevator will be initially created.
2. **REACT_APP_SPEED**: This variable controls the speed of the elevator, measured in milliseconds per floor.
3. **REACT_APP_EXECUTION_TIME**: By modifying this variable, you can adjust the duration for which the randomizer will generate random requests for the elevator system.
